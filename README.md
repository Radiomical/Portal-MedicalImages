A social portal for medical images built on Django. It offers user creation, registration, and authentication options.

The most valuable aspect of the project is its presentation of medical images, primarily CT scans, which are automatically anonymized and displayed in a way similar to how they are used for medical diagnosis. 
This is achieved through scrolling. In this case, this was implemented using JavaScript within the "blog" application.
